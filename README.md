# FriendZone
FriendZone is a school assignment that I did in September 2019 for the class Advanced JavaScript 


## Startup 

Before you can start FriendZone you are going to need two API keys. 
One is for opencagedata.com the other one is for mockaroo.com. 

The keys should be placed in a file that has the following path and name: 

`./backend/secrets/SuperSecretAPIKey.js`

The file look like this: 

```

```

Once the API Keys are in place, go to the root of the project and run

### `npm install`

### `npm run build`

### `cd backend`

### `node index.js`

or 

### `nodemon index.js`
